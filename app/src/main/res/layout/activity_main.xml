        android:text="The Golden Gate Bridge is a suspension bridge spanning the Golden Gate,the one-mile-wide (1.6 km) strait connecting San Francisco Bay and the Pacific Ocean.The structure links the U.S. city of San Francisco, California—the northern tip of theSan Francisco Peninsula—to Marin County, carrying both U.S. Route 101 and California State Route 1 across the strait. It also carries pedestrian and bicycle traffic, and is designated as part of U.S. Bicycle Route 95. Being declared one of the Wonders of the Modern World by the American Society of Civil Engineers, the bridge is one of the most internationally recognized symbols of San Francisco and California. It was initially designed by engineer Joseph Strauss in 1917. Before the bridge was built, the only practical short route between San Francisco and what is now Marin County was by boat across a section of San Francisco Bay. A ferry service began as early as 1820, with a regularly scheduled service beginning in the 1840s for the purpose of transporting water to San Francisco.The        Land and Ferry Company service, launched in 1867, eventually became the Golden Gate Ferry Company, a Southern Pacific Railroad subsidiary, the largest ferry operation in the world by the late 1920s.Once for railroad passengers and customers only,Southern Pacific's automobile ferries became very profitable and important to the regional economy.The ferry crossing between the Hyde Street Pier in San Francisco and Ferry Terminal in Marin County took approximately 20 minutes and cost $1.00 per vehicle, a price later reduced to compete with the new bridge.The trip from the San Francisco Ferry Building took 27 minutes."
